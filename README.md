## Project Motivation
It all started with my brother had funny ideas to make beverage menus/promo brochure with Instagram layout and he asked if I could do it with Illustrator.

I figured that as a developer, it would be quite redundant for me to keep going back to Illustrator if there is a change or new picture. I made it a web app so anyone can modify it and export it as svg and readjust the size in a vector image editor.
